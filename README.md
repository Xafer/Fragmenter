# Fragmenter
Fragmenter framework

The Fragmenter framework is a library used to simplify making OpenGL projects.

The main reason this project exists is to practice my programming, to provide a tool that will shorten work time for future projects and so other people may learn and or use it.

It can be used as the base structure of most opengl projects and includes most things required to make a game's graphic engine.

An feature worth mentionning is that the user creates his own model formats implementing a base model with one method: draw. This makes implementing a new model format much more easy.

I will add more informations when necessary.
